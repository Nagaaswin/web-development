<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is an ordinary paragraph. Notice that this text is blue. The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.</p>

<h1>Heading 1 (center)</h1>
<h2>Heading 2 (left)</h2>
<h3>Heading 3 (right)</h3>

<p>The three headings above are aligned center, left and right.</p>

<h1>Example text-align: justify;</h1>

<p>The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and magazines).</p>
