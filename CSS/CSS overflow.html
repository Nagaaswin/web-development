    <h1>CSS Layout - overflow</h1>
    <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>
    <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>

    <div class="visible">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
    <h2>Overflow: hidden</h2>
    <p>With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:</p>
    <p>Try to remove the overflow property to understand how it works.</p>

    <div class="hidden">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
    <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>
    <p>Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):</p>

    <div class="scroll">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
    <h2>Overflow: Auto</h2>
    <p>The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when necessary:</p>

    <div class="Auto">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
    <h2>Overflow : x and y axis spearatly</h2>
    <p>You can also change the overflow of content horizontally or vertically.</p>
    <p>overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.<br>
      overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.</p>

    <div class="xy">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
  </body>
